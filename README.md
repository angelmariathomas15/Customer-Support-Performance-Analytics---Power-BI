# 👩🏻‍💻🎧Customer Support Performance Analytics - Power-BI

1. Project Overview

This project is my first Power BI report, built as part of my internship at Luminar Technolab.
The report focuses on analyzing customer support ticket data to understand resolution performance, ticket distribution, customer satisfaction, and priority handling.
The objective was to convert raw support data into meaningful insights through data cleaning, modeling, and visualization using Power BI Desktop.

2. Tech Stack

List of key tools and technologies used to build this Power BI report:

🖥️ Power BI Desktop – Primary data visualization and report development platform

🔄 Power Query – Data cleaning, transformation, and preparation

🧮 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Creation of KPIs, measures, and calculated fields

📁 File Formats – .pbix for report development and .png for dashboard-style preview images


3. Data Source

Details about where the data comes from and how it is structured:

📄 Source Type – Structured customer support ticket dataset (CSV format) - customer_support_tickets.csv from Kaggle

🏷️ Data Coverage – Ticket information including channel, priority, status, ticket type, and customer satisfaction scores

🧹 Preprocessing – Data cleaning and standardization performed using Power Query before analysis

4. Features / Highlights

🧩 Business Problem

Customer support teams handle a high volume of tickets across multiple channels and priorities.
However, without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to:

▪ Track resolution efficiency

▪ Identify bottlenecks in ticket handling

▪ Understand customer satisfaction trends

This project addresses the need for data-driven insights to improve support performance and decision-making.

🎯 Goal of the Report

The goal of this Power BI report is to:

▪ Monitor overall customer support performance

▪ Analyze ticket resolution rates across channels and ticket types

▪ Evaluate workload distribution by priority and status

▪ Measure customer satisfaction across support channels


📊 Walkthrough of Key Visuals

▪ KPI Cards – Total tickets, closed tickets, active tickets, resolution rate, and average CSAT score

▪ Resolution Rate by Channel & Ticket Type – Identifies which channels and ticket categories perform better

▪ Ticket Status Distribution – Visualizes open, closed, and pending tickets

▪ Ticket Status by Priority – Compares workload across Medium, Low, High, and Critical priorities

▪ Customer Satisfaction by Channel – Highlights channels delivering better customer experience

💡 Business Impact & Insights

▪ Identifies high-performing and underperforming support channels

▪ Helps prioritize resources for critical and high-priority tickets
